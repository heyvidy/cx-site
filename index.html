                    Today security teams tend to deploy an array of security analytics tools and technologies to collect, process, analyze, and act upon growing volumes of security telemetry. Despite this investment, however, many organizations continue to find it difficult
                    to manage cyber risk or detect and respond to cyber incidents.
